        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m a passionate and dedicated game programmer based in Nigeria, with a focus on developing engaging and immersive gaming experiences. At 24 years old, I have cultivated a strong foundation in Unity, honing my skills in game development and optimization to ensure high-performance gameplay.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working on an exciting endless runner game called <strong>Tegwolo</strong>, collaborating with a talented designer, Ajebo. This project has provided me with invaluable experience in implementing object pooling for efficient prefab spawning and optimizing gameplay mechanics. I am also exploring the world of rhythm games, where I leverage my programming skills to create dynamic gameplay that syncs visuals to audio.</p>
        <p>I am committed to growing my expertise in game development and aspire to become a highly competitive candidate for international game studios. My learning path includes advancing my skills in C++, Win32 programming, and DirectX, alongside mastering Unity. I am driven by a vision to build a thriving game studio, <strong>House of Ajebo</strong>, where I plan to assemble a talented team of 3D animators and fellow developers to create innovative games that resonate with players around the globe.</p>
        <p>As I continue my journey in the gaming industry, I welcome opportunities to connect and collaborate with like-minded professionals. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact section!</p>
