        <h3>Nasirudeen Sulaimon</h3> <!-- Replace with your actual full name -->
       <p>I am a dedicated solo game developer with a strong technical background and a passion for creating engaging and dynamic gaming experiences. Skilled in Unity 3D and C#, I specialize in areas essential to game development, including Unity Shaders, Artificial Intelligence for gameplay, Game Mathematics, and Physics. My expertise enables me to craft seamless, optimized games with a high level of realism and interactivity.</p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I use tools like <strong>Cascadeur</strong> to animate characters with lifelike movement, adding depth to the gameplay experience. My knowledge of C++ allows me to develop custom tools and extensions to enhance Unity’s capabilities, streamline production, and create efficient workflows for complex projects.</p>
    <p>Driven by a commitment to quality, I continuously push myself to learn and implement best practices in game development, from physics simulation to advanced AI behavior. I am excited to bring my skills to new challenges, creating captivating games that resonate with players and contribute to the future of interactive entertainment.</p>
